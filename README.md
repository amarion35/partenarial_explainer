# Partenarial Explainer

Partenarial Explainer is a method of interpretability based on the concept of partenarial examples. For a binary classification task, the method aims, for a selected input, to find the closest example in the other class. In a fault detection task this method helps to identify the actions to take to 'repair' a faulty example.

This method is applied to XGBoost models. The first step consist in approximating the XGBoost model with a differentiable one with a method called DFE (Differentiable Forest Estimator). Then we research a partenarial example with DDN (Decoupling Direction and Norm[1]).
